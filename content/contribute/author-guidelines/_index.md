# Author Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in writing a lesson!

This page gives you a quick overview on how to make a contribution.

- **What to write about**  
  We welcome lessons related to research software development in the digital humanities and all that relates to building the skills necessary for that.
  This can include topics that belong in the toolkit and skillset of a Digital Humanities research software developer—ranging from beginner to advanced—such as getting started with version control, structuring software projects, ensuring reproducible research, or setting up computing environments.

- **Tone and style**  
  Aim for a clear and accessible tone. You don’t need to write in an academic style—write as if you’re explaining something helpful to a colleague. Use headings, short paragraphs, and code snippets or images where useful.

- **Links and references**  
  Include links to tools, resources, or examples where relevant. You can collect references to existing tutorials on the same topic you are writing about and also resources for more advanced steps. Make sure they work and point to stable sources when possible.

- **Submitting your draft**  
  You can submit your draft as a Markdown file.

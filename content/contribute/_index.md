We are happy you want to contribute to our lessons! On this page you will find details about how you can contribute with a lesson or with suggestions of changes and corrections to our content. Here you will also find the author guidelines for lesson contributions.

You can collaborate by submitting issues on [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/dh-tech/wg-education-training). To facilitate that we have created templates for the most common types of contribution, that means you only have to fill in the fields in the issue template which is most appropriate for your contribution.

## Propose a new Lesson

We welcome contributions of new lessons to the website. If you want to contribute by writing a lesson on a specific topic, you can submit an issue in our GitHub repository.

To propose a new lesson you need to submit a proposed topic for your lesson, a brief justification (150 words) and a short abstract describing the lesson (150 words). You can also indicate co-contributors (co-authors) or ask us to help you find someone to help you create this new lesson. To create the issue on our GitHub repository you will also need a GitHub account.

## Suggest a Change

Have you noticed any errors, gaps or mistakes that need our attention? Please let us know so that we can correct it.

If there is anything you think should be corrected or changed, you can also use our issue template to inform us. To suggest a change you will need to indicate the page of reference, the change you think needs to be implemented as well as a justification. If you are willing to collaborate on the implementation of the change, you can also indicate that in the issue. To create the issue on our GitHub repository you will also need a GitHub account.
